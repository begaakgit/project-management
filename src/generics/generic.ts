/**
 * Generics : Sometimes we come accross a situation to repeat the same block of code for different types. So instead of 
 * writing repeated block of code, generics let us write a generalized form of methods.
 * Although, there is a type called any, which we can use to achieve the same effect as generics in our code, 
 * any is not type-safe, and chances are that our application can get an exception. Furthermore, we can apply generics 
 * in TypeScript to classes, interfaces, and functions.
 * Generic Class: Like generic functions, we can make our classes generic as well. Weâ€™ll pass the type parameter, 
 * as usual, in angle (<>) brackets. Then use it across the class for defining methods and properties.
